An automated unofficial iCal calendar generator for Pokémon GO events powered by Leek Duck, so you can easily have a
Pokémon GO calendar on your phone (iOS & Android) or computer (Linux, macOS & Windows) that is always up-to-date.

Take a look at [the website](https://gocalendar.info/) to get setup with the calendar.

# Sources & Credit

All events are sourced from [Leek Duck](https://leekduck.com/events/)
via [bigfoott/ScrapedDuck](https://github.com/bigfoott/ScrapedDuck), using
the [events JSON resource](https://github.com/bigfoott/ScrapedDuck/wiki/Events).

This project just aims to take all that brilliant hard work and dedication from the Leek Duck team, that is presented
oh-so nicely on the Leek Duck website, and create a highly convenient and easily consumable auto-updating iCal calendar
for use in any modern calendar client.

# Development

Project is just a simple PHP CLI script using a few Symfony libraries for the sake of convenience, not the best and far
from optimal, but fast and easy to maintain. The idea is to just have it get executed every 24 hours by a GitHub Action
workflow, in which it updates the output fragment of `./dist/gocal.ics` and commits it back to the `main` repo branch.
This keeps the URL consistent so in theory calendar clients should be able to subscribe to it.

There is a makefile in the root of the project that does most of the heavy lifting. A brief overview of the current
makefile:

```shell
# Build the relevant Docker containers for the project
make build

# Bring up/define in waiting the Docker containers for the project in detached mode
make up

# Tear down the running containers 
make down

# Tear down and bring back up the containers for the project, shortcut for:
# $ make down && make up
make restart

# Install the project dependencies via the project container
make install

# Lint the projects code via the project container
make lint

# Generate the calendar file into dist/gocal.ics via the project container 
make gen

# Build the pages site into a static HTML file in pages/dist 
make site

# Delete all generated assets in the dist folder 
make clean
```

As for the code itself, `bin/gocal` is the entrypoint of this CLI tool. It will bootstrap the Symfony console library
and pull in the instructed commands from `src/Commands`.

Hopefully the code should be clear enough to be self documenting, although I'm not usually one to rely on such things
alone, given the relative size of the project and associated debug output lines enclosing code blocks, it should be fine
in this circumstance. If the project grows any larger, then I'll produce the appropriate documentation to support it.

## A note on time zones and local time

This was a pain in the arse to solve, and I went through a lot of iterations coming up with a working solution. I had to
get my hands dirty and go digging, looking at the generated date output formats in the iCal file and delve into the
Spatie iCal library source to figure out what it was doing that it shouldn't be.

The first clue was in the generated dates in the output iCal file, any start and end dates that also had times were
suffixed with a `Z`. According to this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7626131/4494375), any start and end dates
with times that end with `Z` will be interpreted in a UTC timezone, regardless of the timezone - or lack thereof - in
the calendar or event.

Next step, we need to remove the `Z` by finding out where and how its being added.

Turns out in `\Spatie\IcalendarGenerator\Properties\DateTimeProperty::getValue` if the DateTime entity passed is in
UTC (which is the default in PHP if no time zone is specified when creating a DateTime entity), regardless of the state
of `withoutTimezone()`, `getValue` will append `Z` to the generated `DateTimeValue` as its **only** checks are if the
DateTime is in UTC and has a time associated with it. The calendar clients will then interpret this as a set UTC time
zone when in fact we didn't want that as we provided no initial time zone and removed time zones
with `withoutTimezone()`.
The [Spatie documentation for `spatie/icalendar-generator`](https://github.com/spatie/icalendar-generator#timezones)
doesn't specify this behaviour, and I believe this to be a bug in the library... kinda. More on that below as I worked
on a potential PR only to hit a _gotcha_ scenario.

To illustrate the issue, this is the current code:

```php
public function getValue(): string
{
    return $this->isUTC() && $this->dateTimeValue->hasTime()
        ? "{$this->dateTimeValue->format()}Z"
        : $this->dateTimeValue->format();
}
```

... and this is what I think it should be:

```php
// Expose the existing $withoutTimeZone parameter captured in the __construct as a class property
private bool $withoutTimeZone;

public function getValue(): string
{
    return $this->isUTC() && $this->dateTimeValue->hasTime() && ! $this->withoutTimeZone
        ? "{$this->dateTimeValue->format()}Z"
        : $this->dateTimeValue->format();
}
```

This as we should only be adding the `Z` suffix if the time zone has been **explicitly** set, otherwise we are getting
the UTC time zone set and thus interpreted by default, which is not intended if you've specified `withoutTimeZone()` on
DateTime's initialised with no time zone, thus defaulting to UTC.

The workaround being to simply set a random time zone on the DateTime being created and then use `withoutTimeZone()`, as
it will correctly strip out/not generate _any_ time zone related properties making all dates interpret as intended -
local time.

Now, back to that kinda, that lovely _gotcha_. I've had a go at patching this bug and submitting a PR for it,
and now I see their problem, and it doesn't really have a clean solution. UTC DateTime's are used for internal time zone
calculations, mainly for setting boundaries to expected time zone shifts, such as during summer. Patching it with
the above fix solves the issues with implicit/default UTC usage and `withoutTimeZone()` used in combination, but breaks
all `DTSTAMP` generation which needs to be UTC based. This is as internally they are using `withoutTimeZone()` to ensure
that all user defined time zones are stripped from these internal DateTime's, to normalise them onto a UTC base,
as is required for fixed points in time such as time zone boundaries. Its not an easy solve without some major
reworking of how dates are safely handled for time zone boundaries in the library.

For now, I'm going to leave my hack in this repo. Setting the time zone to GMT on the event dates in combination with
using `withoutTimeZone()` allows the library to skip the UTC logic, giving the desired effect of local times on the
events due to the UTC `Z` suffix **and** all time zone stuff being dropped from the generated iCal file. I'll maybe
submit a PR just with a documentation change to alert other future users of the library to this _gotcha_ scenario,
although I need to find a good way of phrasing it before I do so, as the above is a bit of a brain-teaser.
